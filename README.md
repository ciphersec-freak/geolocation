# IP Geolocation Script
This repository contains a Python script that can automatically perform geolocation of an IP address. Running the script will retrieve various details about a specific IP address.

‚úÖ What is Geolocation? 

Geolocation is a method used to extract information about an IP address. It is commonly used for gathering large-scale data from an IP address.

‚úÖ How does this script work? 

This Python script employs several libraries, including IPinfo and Colorama. IPinfo is a reliable and accurate source of IP address data, offering extensive information about IP addresses. Meanwhile, Colorama enables ANSI escape character sequences, which are used to produce colored terminal text and cursor positioning, to work under MS Windows.

üíª How to Run the Script? 

To run the script, you need to have Python installed on your system, along with the necessary Python libraries, such as IPinfo and Colorama. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer.

Here's an example of how you can install IPinfo and Colorama:
```python
pip install IPinfo
pip install Colorama
```

After installing Python and the required libraries, you can execute the Python script using the following command in the terminal:

```python
python3 main.py
```
